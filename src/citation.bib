Nor does Broca area infarction cause Broca aphasia. The lesions in 20 cases observed since 1972 were documented by autopsy, computerized tomography, or arteriogram; the autopsy records from the Massachusetts General hospital for the past 20 years and the published cases since 1820 were also reviewed. The findings suggest that infarction affecting the Broca area and its immediate environs, even deep into the brain, causes a mutism that is replaced by a rapidly improving dyspraxic and effortful articulation, but that no significant disturbance in language function persists. The more complex syndrome traditionally referred to as Broca aphasia, including Broca{\textquoteright}s original case, is characterized by protracted mutism, verbal stereotypes, and agrammatism. It is associated with a considerably larger infarct which encompasses the operculum, including the Broca area, insula, and adjacent cerebrum, in the territory supplied by the upper division of the left middle cerebral artery.},

Although aphasic disability is complex, many aphasic patients are clinically similar and fall into recurring identifiable groups. Over the years, a bewildering amount of nomenclature has been used to describe and classify the various aphasia syndromes. This vast amount of terminology serves to confuse the student of aphasiology in that, dependent upon their own individual concept and model of language, different authors have often used different terms to describe the same aphasic disturbance. For instance, at various times the aphasic disturbance associated with damage to the anterior language centre has been referred to as Broca's aphasia, motor aphasia, efferent motor aphasia and verbal aphasia.",

  abstract="Precise, bilateral radio-frequency lesions of pars compacta of the substantia nigra in rats resulted in the immediate and sustained appearance of hyperactivity, but such lesions did not produce significant alterations in food or water intake. These behavioral effects were correlated with considerable, histochemically assessed loss of dopamine terminals in the caudate-putamen complex, but dopamine innervation in nucleus accumbens and other forebrain areas was only slightly affected. The magnitude of motor activity increase was positively correlated with the degree of pars compacta involvement. Animals with lesions in the median raphe and adjacent reticular formation also displayed chronic hyperactivity. In contrast to rats receiving discrete radio-frequency lesions of pars compacta, animals with bilateral mesencephalic ablations produced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 8 $\mu$g/4 $\mu$l or 4 $\mu$g/2 $\mu$l in combination with desipramine pretreatment) displayed poverty of movement. Furthermore, significant, dose-dependent decrements in food and water intake were seen after 6-OHDA. The nonselective component of such lesions was frequently large and irregular in shape. Occasional ablations produced by this neurotoxin, however, appeared more selective in that damage was confined primarily to pars compacta. Nonetheless, the best correlate of aphagia and adipsia associated with 6-OHDA treatment was lesion size, regardless of the extent of pars compacta or other nigral involvement. We conclude that aphagia and adipsia concomitant to 6-OHDA lesions of the substantia nigra result from the incidental destruction of extra-nigral systems. Virtually complete, but precise, lesions of pars compacta do not produce aphagia and adipsia. While our results are consistent with the notion that the substantia nigra serves an important role in the regulation of motor activity, they provide no support for the conjecture that it is importantly involved in mediating ingestive behaviors.",

  In the last decade transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been introduced in aphasia post-stroke recovery as a tool for modulating neuroplasticity. However, it is still unclear whether tDCS should be applied at rest (off-line) or combined with behavioral treatment strategies (on-line), therefore, this study investigates the effect of repeated sessions of off-line tDCS on language recovery in post-stroke chronic aphasic patients.
  Methodology
  Eight post-stroke patients with different type and degree of chronic aphasia underwent two weeks of off-line anodal tDCS (2mA intensity for 20min a day) on Broca's area and two weeks of sham stimulation as a control condition. Language recovery was measured assessing object and action naming abilities with a computerized picture naming task.
  Results
  No significant difference between anodal tDCS and sham stimulation, both for object and action naming tasks, was found. Descriptive analysis of single cases showed that after tDCS only one patient improved substantially on action naming task.
  Conclusion
  With the exception of one patient, the overall results suggest that in chronic aphasic patients the off-line tDCS protocol applied in this study is not effective in improving noun and verb naming abilities."

  Motor cortex stimulation (MCS) was introduced in the early 1990s by Tsubokawa and his group for patients diagnosed with drug-resistant, central neuropathic pain. Inconsistencies concerning the details of this therapy and its outcomes and poor methodology of most clinical essays divide the neuromodulation society worldwide into “believers” and “nonbelievers.” A European expert meeting was organized in Brussels, Belgium by the Benelux Neuromodulation Society in order to develop uniform MCS protocols in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses.
  Methods
  An expert meeting was organized, and a questionnaire was sent out to all the invited participants before this expert meeting. An extensive literature research was conducted in order to enrich the results.
  Results
  Topics that were addressed during the expert meeting were 1) inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2) targeting and methods of stimulation, 3) effects of MCS, and 4) results from the questionnaire.
  Conclusions
  Substantial commonalities but also important methodologic divergencies emerged from the discussion of MCS experts from 7 European Centers. From this meeting and questionnaire, all participants concluded that there is a need for more homogenous standardized protocols for MCS regarding patient selection, implantation procedure, stimulation parameters, and follow-up-course."

  ABSTRACT={Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second leading cause of dementia following Alzheimer's disease (AD) and accounts for up to 25% of all dementia.  DLB is distinct from AD in that it involves extensive neuropsychiatric symptoms as well as motor symptoms, leads to enormous societal costs in terms of direct medical care and is associated with high financial and caregiver costs.  Although there are no disease-modifying therapies for DLB, we review several new therapeutic directions in treating DLB.  We discuss progress in strategies to decrease the level of alpha-synuclein, to prevent the cell to cell transmission of misfolded alpha-synuclein, and the potential of brain stimulation in DLB.}

Electromyogram (EMG) patterns and stride parameters were assessed before and after the test without RAS to evaluate changes in gait patterns. Data were compared with those of two control groups (n = 11), who either did not participate in any gait training or who participated in an internally self-paced training program. RAS consisted of audiotapes with metronome-pulse patterns embedded into the on/off beat structure of rhythmically accentuated instrumental music. Patients who trained with RAS significantly (p < 0.05) improved their gait velocity by 25\%, stride length by 12\%, and step cadence by 10\% more than self-paced subjects who improved their velocity decreased by 7\% and no-training subjects whose velocity decreased by 7\%. In the RAS-group, timing of EMG patterns changed significantly (p < 0.05) in the anterior tibialis and vastus lateralis muscles. Evidence for rhythmic entrainment of gait patterns was shown by the ability of the RAS group to reproduce the speed of the last training tape within a 2\% margin of error without RAS.},,
